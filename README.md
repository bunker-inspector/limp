# limp

A tiny library (if it can be called that) for making slackbots in Clojure

## Usage

A bot is created by calling the `start!` function where every 2 arguments is a predicate and a handler, resectively.
A predicate will return true if the following handler should respond to it. The handler should return 
a `Response` record.

Valid event types are the clj-ified versions of the ones listed [here](https://api.slack.com/rtm)

The `"SLACK_TOKEN"` environment variable should be set as your legacy bot token

Here's an example of a bot that will respond whenever anyone is typing (probably don't do this)
```clojure
(require '[limp.client.rtm :refer :all])

(start! (fn [{type :type}]
            (= :user-typing type))

        (fn [{channel :channel}]
            (Response. channel "someone is typing")))
```
